## Socratic method in the REPL

Using repl to debug our thinking
At the end of the day, is 'informing business strategy'
Informing and defining business models
Bayesian methodology is tailor-made for decision making

In lancaster handout - anywhere it says 'econometrics', replace with 'data analysis'

- Frequentist

  - Sampling theory
  - Ontological

- Bayesian / Subjective:

  - Dealing with the data we have at hand.
  - "Projecting from our mind onto the world" - Only exists in our minds
  - Bruno De Finetti - The theory of probability
  - Epistomological
  - Significant component of data analysis that is objective
  - The Theory That Would Not Die - Read it, write a report. extra credit
  - Game theorist article - Agreeing to Disagree - Robert Aumann
    - Can't be rational and 'agree to disagree' - Convergence of beliefs
  - Dutch book theorem. 'coherence' - Does not exist as a frequentist
  - Generalization of Aristotalion logic
  - There are statements that we know that we cannot prove
    - Gurdel's(sp) theorem
  - Bayes Rule:
    - P(ø|x) proportional to P(x|ø)P(ø)
      - ø = Uncertainty
      - x = our data
      - Probability of Theta (ø) given x is proportional to Probablity of x given Theta time P of theta
      - P(ø|x) = Posterior
      - p(x|ø) = Likelihood - Objective component
      - p(ø) = Prior - Subjective component
